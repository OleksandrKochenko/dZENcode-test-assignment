## Introduction

This project aims to create a simple and functional REST API server (Back End) for Comments application. <br/>

It includes:

- user authorisation section, that allows to register, login, logout and update user as well as fetch users information
- comments section, that allows to create, fetch, update or delete comments <br/>

Full functionality is provided in [API documentation](https://api-comments-chi.vercel.app/)

## Description

With this REST API you can make GET, POST, PUT and DELETE requests with following functionality:

- register a new User (available to add image for user's avatar)
- login / logout User
- get data of current User
- update User data (including updating of avatar image)
- get a list of Comments from DB according to query parameters (page & limit)
- get or delete Comment by id
- create a new Comment with an unauthorized User, using reCAPTCHA validation
- create a new Comment by an authorized user (available to add images or/and text file to the Comment)
- get a list of Comments of an authorized user
- get a list of Users (Performed without authorization for presentation purposes, since the user database is a mock and does not include sensitive data)
- get a User data by id (Performed without authorization for presentation purposes, since the user database is a mock and does not include sensitive data)

All POST, PUT and DELETE requests pass through different validations. POST requests processes by cropping and optimizing images. Implemented size limit and file type validation for images.
As a addition feature, the program includes a data generator for seeding fake data to the database (Users and Comments).

Detailed description of API documentation you can find on https://api-comments-chi.vercel.app/
